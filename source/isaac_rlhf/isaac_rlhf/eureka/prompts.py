PREFERENCE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a skilled preference annotator for robotic reinforcement learning tasks.
Your job is to compare two different RL policies and determine which one is better at solving the task described in text.
For each policy, you will be given a list of metrics and how they progressed over training.
These metrics can be loss, each reward term value, task success rate, etc.

Do not make the mistake of simply favoring the policy with the higher success rate.
There may be qualitative differences that are not captured by the success rate.
Inspect the values of each metric closely and make a comprehensive decision on your preference.

In your response, provide your preference and briefly explain your reasoning in a single sentence.

"""
PREFERENCE_USER_PROMPT = """
You are a skilled preference annotator for robotic reinforcement learning tasks.
Give your preference between the two policies based on the metrics provided and briefly explain your reasoning in a single sentence.
Here are the metrics for the two policies:
policy_0:
{metrics_policy_0}

policy_1:
{metrics_policy_1}

Your response must follow the example format.

Example 1:

preference: policy_0
reasoning: policy_0 has a higher success rate and lower loss.

Example 2:

preference: policy_1    
reasoning: both policies have similar success rates, but policy_1 has better reward term values.

"""
DIRECT_WORKFLOW_REWARD_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs.
It must comply to the following signature exactly:

def _get_rewards_eureka(self) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    ...
    return reward, individual_rewards_dict

Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as self.device.
The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward, which has a dimension of (self.num_envs,) and is a torch.Tensor,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```" and contain only the get_rewards_eureka function.

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
"""

MANAGER_BASED_WEIGHT_TUNING_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Your new configuraiton string should comply exactly with the structure of the previous configuration.
The configuration you are given is not full configuration of the environment, but rather a selected subset that I wish to tune.
Do not add new terms or remove existing terms, comply with the previous configuration.
It will generally look like:
    {'reward.term_name.weight': value_1, 'curriculum.term_name.param_name': value_2, ...}
I will use regex pattern of the above structure to extract the keys and values from your response. 
Use the same keys as the previous configuration, but suggest new values.
If term name is reset_robot_joints but you say reset_robot_joint in your response, I will not be able to extract the key and value, so mind the spelling.

Here are some tips for the terms in general. Sometimes certain terms below might not be present in my choice of subset for tuning.

A key, 'reward.term_name.weight' for example, is a string enclosed by a single quote. The dots inside are used to reconstruct a nested dictionary.
The value will be mostly float or int, but always comply with the type of the previous configuration.
Negative reward weights are posssible, terms with negative weights serve as penalty rather than reward.

Note that num_step values in curriculum is in units of simulation steps, which is 24 * learning iterations.
For example, if num_step_start is 4800, the curriculum starts at 4800/24 = 200 learning iterations.
When you suggest new num_step values, please make sure they are multiples of 24.
By common sense, 0 < num_step_start < num_step_end < 24 * max_learning_iterations.

Some curriculum terms are activated and deactivated by performance, and by performance I mean value of a specific reward term linked to the curriculum term.
If performance_low is 0.8, it means the curriculum term will start when the value of the specific reward term is greater than 0.8.
If performance_high is 0.9, it means the curriculum term will stop when the value of the specific reward term is greater than 0.9.
If performance never reaches 0.8, this curriculum term will never even start.
Therefore, your choice of performance_low and performance_high should be reachable during training.
A good heuristic is 0 < performance_low < performance_high < 0.7

You are not obliged to change all values. If a certain value looks good in the previous run, you can keep it as it is.
If training is not going well, you are encouraged to make wild guesses.

MANAGER_BASED_PPO_TUNING_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Your ppo hyperparameter tuning string should comply exactly with the previous tuning configuration.
    {'param_name_1': value_1, 'param_name_2': value_2, ...}
I will use regex pattern of the above structure to extract the ppo hyperparameters and suggested tuning values from your response.
param_name is a string and must be enclosed by a single quote.
param_name may contain dots, such as "agent.learning_rate_scheduler_kwargs.kl_threshold". Dots indicate a deeper level of nested dictionary.
value can be float or boolean, but always comply with the type of the previous configuration.
Note, if you think value of a certain parameter was good in the previous run, you can keep it as it is. You are not obliged to change all values, especially the boolean ones.
